 * Use this template as a guide to building components.
 * The goal is to create components that all share the same 
 * lifecycle and functionalty.
 * 
 * Where possible, use/create Common Components if the component is/will:
 * - Be used more than once
 * - Repeats code 
 * - Is a useful feature, which could be inherited by other modules
 * 
 * The outline for the app architecture can be found here:
